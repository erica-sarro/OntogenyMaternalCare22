We have to manually download each project file from BORIS. Each project is a single aggregated data file and represents one nest (ex. QF01). To download Boris files into a directory for data cleaning, do the following:
1) Open project file in BORIS
2) Observations -> Export Events -> Aggregated events
3) Press select all and then ok 
4) Select all subjects then all behaviors, press ok 
5) Group selected events into one file 
6) Save file as nest name eg. "QF01" as a .csv file in the BORISfiles directory 
*Note: all state events must be paired to export as an aggregated file 
*Note: these files do not include observations that did not contain scored behaviors and do not include bees with no observed behaviors 

Videos are named in the format "camera / nestID / YYYYMMDD / HH", where camera is either "for" (foraging/food collection chambers) or "nest"
 (interior of nest)
 
Nests were originally coded as QA (i.e. Queen Alone), QT (i.e. Queen and Three workers), and QF (i.e. Queen and Five workers). group codes were changed to subsocial, eusocial (3W), and eusocial (5W), respectively, for the manuscript.
